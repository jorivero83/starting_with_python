# starting_with_python
This is step by step guide to starting with Python.

## Step1: Install Python
- [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe) 
- The following guide could be usefull: https://docs.python.org/es/3/using/windows.html (Spanish for better understanding).
- I prefer set the installation path into a custom location to get more control of everything e.g. C:/python

## Step2: Create a python environment to work
- https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/venv.html
- This is very important step because when you develop a python project for a company, we need to control package dependencies to further deployment of the application when you finish, and it's paramount to get success on production environments.

## Step3: Install Visual Studio Code
- Download the installer from: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Install the IDE using the tipical steps on windows. 

## Step4: Read the book "Learning Python" from [biblio](./biblio/9781783551712-LEARNING_PYTHON.pdf)
- Unzip the corresponding files and codes. Then you can play with the code. Happy coding :).

## Step5: Read the book "Mastering Python" from [biblio](./biblio/9781785289729-MASTERING_PYTHON.pdf)
- Unzip the book resources and play with the code.
